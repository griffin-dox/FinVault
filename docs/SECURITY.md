# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies and best practices for the FinVault application.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults
- Principle of least privilege

### 2. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Regular security audits

### 3. Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Session management

## Security Measures

### Frontend Security

#### 1. Input Validation
- All user inputs must be validated
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement client-side validation with server-side verification

#### 2. XSS Prevention
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

#### 3. CSRF Protection
- Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Implement SameSite cookie attributes
- Validate request origins

#### 4. Environment Variables
- Never expose sensitive data in client-side code
- Use VITE_ prefix for public variables only
- Keep secrets server-side

### Backend Security

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

#### 2. API Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- NoSQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration

#### 3. Database Security
- Parameterized queries
- Connection encryption
- Regular backups
- Access logging

#### 4. Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Proper logging without exposing secrets
- Graceful error handling

### Infrastructure Security

#### 1. Environment Variables
- Use .env files for local development
- Use platform environment variables for production
- Never commit secrets to version control

#### 2. HTTPS Only
- Force HTTPS in production
- HSTS headers
- Secure cookie attributes

#### 3. Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Use only trusted packages

## Security Headers

### Required Headers
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```
